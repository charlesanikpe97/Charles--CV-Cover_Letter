		<h3>PROFILE</h3>
		<p>Hello, my name is Charles Anikpe, and I am 23 years old. I was born in Rome, Italy, and I am currently residing in Glasgow, Scotland. I am pursuing my Computer Science Degree through the Open University while simultaneously working as a warehouse associate for Amazon UK. I have a passion for learning, and I’m eager to further my career within the company. I am working full time for Amazon at DXG1, Motherwell, Glasgow.</p>

		<h3>COVER LETTER</h3>
		<h4>TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN</h4>
		<p>I apply with great enthusiasm as a first-year Bachelor of Computing and IT (Software Engineering) student at The Open University for a space in your Software Development Engineering Apprenticeship program commencing September 2021 in Edinburgh. I'm confident that I would make for a distinct software engineer apprentice due to my ambitious nature and my insatiable desire to learn. My passion for learning stems from a very young age. When born and brought up in Rome, Italy, I had to face the challenges of learning two languages, English and, most importantly, Italian. I spoke English indoors and Italian outdoors; this resulted in quickly becoming bilingual. A second testament to my desire for knowledge occurred at a much older age when my everlasting love for technology blossomed. Precisely, this love and wish I nurture for IT started about five years ago, when I decided to move to Glasgow to further my education while working. I taught myself by taking IT recognised certifications such as Amazon Web Services Solutions Architect Associate and Cloud Practitioner certification. I kept learning steadily, resulting in two ulterior IT certifications, CompTIA A+ and CompTIA IT Fundamentals +. I achieved these outstanding IT certifications in four months while working night shifts full time as a Sortation Associate at Amazon in Glasgow (DXG1). This is a prime example of my determination, ambition, insatiable desire to learn and perhaps, more importantly, my ability to deliver results. Not only did I achieve these certifications, but I cleared them with close to perfect marks. Perusing these certifications made me realise how broad IT is and how it governs our modern world. Therefore I decided I would specialise in the software engineering field. I enrolled for an online Computer Science and Web development introductory course offered by Harvard University on an educational website called edX. Once I completed the studies, I just knew that I was born to become a software engineer. As soon as I understood programming concepts, I knew it was time for me to put them into practice, so I subscribed to a website called Codecademy and enrolled to study Computing and IT at the Open University. In addition to the activities I carry out during my spare time, I haven't failed to earn my managers trust and deliver results. I'm a permanent Amazon employee on track to becoming a permanent Operational Supervisor. Working at Amazon has been a highlight in my life, and this opportunity would be a match made in heaven, getting paid to learn while in your dream job and your dream company. I would apply for the position even if I have to pay for my learning and work for free. I have attached my resume for your consideration, which I hope will showcase my previous roles' strengths. Specifically, my recent experience as a step-up Operation supervisor for Amazon during peak 2020, where I completely embodied the leadership principles, displayed my ability to put them into action. Living by these leadership principles is a crucial part of any role within Amazon, and I believe this to be especially true for an apprenticeship. All of which proves that I would be the perfect candidate for this opportunity.</p>
