# Charles--CV-Cover_Letter
<p>Yay! This is my very first <strong><em>HTML project</em></strong>! The goal was to replicate the CV I used to apply for a Software Engineering Apprenticeship role at Amazon, exclusively using my newly acquired HTML skills.
Future versions may involve addition of CSS elements and updated text, content more relevant with my skill level.</p>
